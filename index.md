# greg-fitzgerald GitHub User Page

This page is used to demonstrate what content I have learned and used throughout the UO CIT minor. This includes my projects up through CIT 281. The site was forked from Professor Michael Hennessy and edited to display my information

## Deployment

As part of this project, we deployed our web app to GitHub user pages.
